# Code Review Notes for HillSearchService

## General Overview
The HillSearchService class is responsible for loading hill data, applying filters, sorting, and limiting results. The implementation is functional but offers several opportunities for architectural and structural improvement.

## Strengths
- Uses Java Stream API effectively for filtering and sorting.
- Maintains readable structure in the searchHills(...) method.
- Good use of DTO (HillSearchRequest) for encapsulating input parameters.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The searchHills method currently:
- Loads data
- Applies filters
- Sorts the results
- Applies limit

Suggestion: Split responsibilities into separate services or components, such as HillFilterService, HillSorter, and HillLimiter.

### 2. Tight Coupling to Data Loader
The class depends directly on HillDataLoader, which currently only supports CSV. This limits the extensibility of the system.

Suggestion: Introduce an interface like HillDataSource with implementations for CSV, JSON, etc.

### 3. Testability
The method is functional but not modular for isolated unit tests.

Suggestion: Extract filter and sort logic into reusable components that can be independently tested.

### 4. Performance and Caching
Data is loaded from the CSV file on every request, which may be inefficient.

Suggestion: Consider using caching mechanisms (e.g., @Cacheable or internal cache) to reduce I/O overhead.

### 5. Case-Insensitive Category Comparison
The filtering by category should be case-insensitive.

Suggestion: Use equalsIgnoreCase or convert strings to uppercase before comparison.

## Summary
HillSearchService is a good foundation but would benefit from cleaner separation of concerns, better testability, and extensible design principles.
